# **What is HTML**

HTML stands for "Hyper-Text Markup Language". It represents the content and structure of a web page through the use of elements. Between the tags we'll have the content. This content can be text of another HTML.

```html
<p>Laxman Krishnamurti</p>
<p>
  <span>Short Heading</span>
</p>
```

Some HTML elements do not have a closing tags these are known as "void elements".

Here is an example of image tag. To display an image on the web page we need to add a couple of attributes inside the image element.

**Attribute ::** An attribute is a special value used to adjust the behavior for an HTML element.

```html
<img
  src="image_location"
  alt="provide_to_short_descriptive_text_for_the_image"
/>
```
