HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language" and it represents the content and structure of a web page.

```html
<h1>It is used for a main heading of a web page.</h1>
```

```html
<h6>
  The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of
  content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h6 has
  less importance than h1. Only use one h1 element per page and place
  lower-importance headings below higher-importance headings.
</h6>
```

```html
<p>It is used to create a pragraph of text on websites.</p>

accessibility. The main-element is used to represent the main content of the
body of an HTML document.
