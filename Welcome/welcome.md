# **`How do most People learn Effectively?`**

Key discoveries that scientists have made about learning : Engineering Professor _Barbara Oakley's_

1. **Spaced Repetition**

Learning half an hour each day for a weak is much more effective than leaning for three and half hours all in one day. This is because of the role that sleep plays in memory. When we sleep, our brain builds and reinforces neural structures.

2. **Interleaving Practice**

Rather than just learning one concepts for an entire study session it's better to get a little exposure to a lots of concepts. This shakes up our brain and forces us to continually reframe what we know.

3. **Active Recall**

It's easy to trick ourself into thinking we're much better at a skill than we actually are. Because almost everyone experience what scientists call an **_illusion of competence._**

But the best way to shatter that illusion is to actively recall and apply what we're learning.
